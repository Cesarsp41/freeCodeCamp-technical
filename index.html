            <h2>C++ What is OOP?</h2>
            <p>OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming.</p>
            <p>Procedural programming is about writing procedures or functions that perform operations on the data, while object-oriented programming is about creating objects that contain both data and functions.</p>
            <p>Object-oriented programming has several advantages over procedural programming:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>OOP is faster and easier to execute</li>
                <li>OOP provides a clear structure for the programs</li>
                <li>OOP helps to keep the C++ code DRY "Don't Repeat Yourself", and makes the code easier to maintain, modify and debug</li>
                <li>OOP makes it possible to create full reusable applications with less code and shorter development time</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Tip</strong>: The "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) principle is about reducing the repetition of code. You should extract out the codes that are common for the application, and place them at a single place and reuse them instead of repeating it.</p>
            <h2>C++ What are Classes and Objects</h2>
            <p>Classes and objects are the two main aspects of object-oriented programming.</p>
            <p>Look at the following illustration to see the difference between class and objects:</p>
            <div class="figure-container">
                <div class="class-figure">
                    <h3 class="figure-header">Class</h3>
                    <p>Fruit</p>
                </div>
                <div class="object-figure">
                    <h3 class="figure-header">Object</h3>
                    <p>Apple</p>
                    <p>Banana</p>
                    <p>Mango</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>So, a class is a template for objects, and an object is an instance of a class.</p>
            <p>When the individual objects are created, they inherit all the variables and functions from the class.</p>

            <h2>C++ Classes/Objects</h2>
            <p>C++ is an object-oriented programming language.</p>
            <p>Everything in C++ is associated with classes and objects, along with its attributes and methods. For example: in real life, a car is an <strong>object</strong>. The car has <strong>attributes</strong>, such as weight and color, and <strong>methods</strong>, such as drive and brake.</p>
            <p>Attributes and methods are basically variables and functions that belongs to the class. These are often referred to as "class members".</p>
            <p>A class is a user-defined data type that we can use in our program, and it works as an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.</p>
            <h2>Create a Class</h2>
            <p>To create a class, use the <span class="red-span">class</span> keyword:</p>
            <code>
                class MyClass {<br>
                &emsp;&emsp;public:<br>       
                &emsp;&emsp;int myNum;<br>       
                &emsp;&emsp;string myString;<br>
                };
            </code>
            <h2>Create an Object</h2>
            <p>In C++, an object is created from a class. We have already created the class named <span class="red-span">MyClass</span>, so now we can use this to create objects.</p>
            <p>To create an object of <span class="red-span">MyClass</span> specify the class name, followed by the object name.</p>
            <p>To access the class attributes (<span class="red-span">myNum</span> and <span class="red-span">myString</span>), use the dot syntax (.) on the object:</p>
            <code>
                class MyClass {<br>    
                &emsp;&emsp;public:<br>    
                &emsp;&emsp;int myNum;<br>   
                &emsp;&emsp;string myString;<br>
                };<br><br>
                
                int main(){<br>
                &emsp;&emsp;myObj.myNum = 15;<br>
                &emsp;&emsp;myObj.myString = "Some text";<br>
                &emsp;&emsp;return 0;<br>
                }<br>
            </code>
            <h2>Multiple Objects</h2>
            <p>You can create multiple objects of one class:</p>
            <code>
                class Car {<br>    
                &emsp;&emsp;public:<br>    
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;string brand;<br>   
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;int year;<br>
                };<br><br>
                int main(){<br>
                &emsp;&emsp;Car carObj1;<br>
                &emsp;&emsp;carObj1.brand = "BMW";<br>
                &emsp;&emsp;carObj1.year = 1999;<br><br>
                &emsp;&emsp;Car carObj2;<br>
                &emsp;&emsp;carObj2.brand = "Ford";<br>
                &emsp;&emsp;carObj2.year = 1969;<br><br>
                return 0;<br>
                }<br>
            </code>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="C++_Class_Methods">
            <header>C++ Class Methods</header>
            <h2>Class Methods</h2>
            <p>Methods are <strong>functions</strong> that belongs to the class.</p>
            <p>There are two ways to define functions that belongs to a class:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Inside class definition</li>
                <li>Outside class definition</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In the following example, we define a function inside the class, and we name it "myMethod".</p>
            <code>
                class myClass {<br>    
                &emsp;&emsp;public:<br>    
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;void myMethod() {<br>   
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;cout &lt;&lt; "Hello World!";<br>
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;};<br>
                }<br>
            </code>
            <p>To define a function outside the class definition, you have to declare it inside the class and then define it outside of the class. This is done by specifiying the name of the class, followed the scope resolution :: operator, followed by the name of the function:</p>
            <code>
                class myClass {<br>    
                &emsp;&emsp;public:<br>    
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;void myMethod()<br>   
                };<br><br>
                void MyClass::myMethod(){<br>
                &emsp;&emsp;cout &lt;&lt; "Hello World!";<br>
                }<br>
            </code>

        <section class="main-section" id="C++_Constructors">
            <header>C++ Constructors</header>
            <h2>Constructors</h2>
            <p>A constructor in C++ is a <strong>special method</strong> that is automatically called when an object of a class is created.</p>
            <p>To create a constructor, use the same name as the class, followed by parentheses ():</p>
            <code>
                class MyClass {<br>
                &emsp;&emsp;public: <br>
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;MyClass() { // Constructor <br>
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;cout &lt;&lt; "Hello World!"; <br>
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;} <br>
                } <br><br>
                int main() { <br>
                &emsp;&emsp;MyClass myObj; <br>
                &emsp;&emsp;return 0;<br>
                } <br>
            </code>
            <h2>Constructor Parameters</h2>
            <p>Constructors can also take parameters (just like regular functions), which can be useful for setting initial values for attributes.</p>
            <p>The following class have brand, model and year attributes, and a constructor with different parameters. Inside the constructor we set the attributes equal to the constructor parameters (brand=x, etc). When we call the constructor (by creating an object of the class), we pass parameters to the constructor, which will set the value of the corresponding attributes to the same:</p>
            <code>
                class Car{ <br>
                &emsp;&emsp;public: <br>
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;string brand; <br>
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;string model; <br>
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;int year; <br>
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Car(string x, string y, int z) { <br>
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;brand = x; <br>
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;model = y; <br>
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;year = z; <br>
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;}<br>
                }; <br>
            </code>
            <p>Just like functions, constructors can also be defined outside the class. First, declare the constructor inside the class, and then define it outside of the class by specifying the name of the class, followed by the scope resolution :: operator, followed by the name of the constructor (which is the same as the class):</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="C++_Access_Specifiers">
            <header>C++ Access Specifiers</header>
            <h2>Acess Specifiers</h2>
            <p>By now, you are quite familiar with the public keyword that appears in all of our class examples:</p>
            <code>
                class MyClass { <br>
                &emsp;&emsp;public: <br>
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; // class members goes here <br>
                }
            </code>
            <p>The public keyword is an access specifier. Access specifiers define how the members (attributes and methods) of a class can be accessed. In the example above, the members are public - which means that they can be accessed and modified from outside the code.</p>
            <p>However, what if we want members to be private and hidden from the outside world?</p>
            <p>In C++, there are three access specifiers:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>public</strong> - members are accessible from outside the class</li>
                <li><strong>private</strong> - members cannot be accessed (or viewed) from outside the class</li>
                <li><strong>protected</strong> - members cannot be accessed from outside the class, however, they can be accessed in inherited classes.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In the following example, we demonstrate the differences between public and private members:</p>
            <code>
                class MyClass { <br>
                &emsp;&emsp;public:<br>
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;int x;<br>
                &emsp;&emsp;private:<br>
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;int y;<br>
                };<br> <br>
                int main() { <br>
                &emsp;&emsp;MyClass myObj; <br>
                &emsp;&emsp;myObj.x = 25; <br>
                &emsp;&emsp;myObj.y = 50; // NOT Allowed (private) <br> 
                }<br>
            </code>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="C++_Encapsulation">
            <header>C++ Encapsulation</header>
            <h2>Encapsulation</h2>
            <p>The meaning of Encapsulation, is to make sure that "sensitive" data is hidden from users. To achieve this, you must declare class variables/attributes as private (cannot be accessed from outside the class). If you want others to read or modify the value of a private member, you can provide public get and set methods.</p>
            <h2>Access Private Members</h2>
            <p>To access a private attribute, use public "get" and "set" methods:</p>
            <code>
                #include &lt;iostream&gt; <br>
                using namespace std; <br><br>
                class Employe { <br>
                &emsp;&emsp;private: <br>
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;int salary <br><br>
                &emsp;&emsp;public: <br>
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;void setSalary(int s) { <br>
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;salary = s; <br>
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;} <br><br>
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;int getSalary() { <br>
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;return salary; <br>
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;} <br>
                }; <br><br>
                int main() { <br>
                &emsp;&emsp;Employee myObj;  <br>
                &emsp;&emsp;myObj.setSalary(50000); <br>
                &emsp;&emsp;cout &lt;&lt; myObj.getSalary(); <br>
                &emsp;&emsp;return 0; <br>
                }
            </code>
            <h3>Example explained</h3>
            <p>The salary attribute is private, which have restricted access.</p>
            <p>The public setSalary() method takes a parameter (s) and assigns it to the salary attribute (salary = s).</p>
            <p>The public getSalary() method returns the value of the private salary attribute.</p>
            <p>Inside main(), we create an object of the Employee class. Now we can use the setSalary() method to set the value of the private attribute to 50000. Then we call the getSalary() method on the object to return the value.</p>
